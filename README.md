# IFN711 - IT Industry Project
As part of its operations, the Company collects data from its members relevant to the use of their NDIS
budgets. The average NDIS beneficiary receives $52,000 in support per annum, but the Company observes
that its members only spend 68% of this amount on average each year. The reasons could range from a
lack of available services in remote areas to a lack of satisfaction with available services. This is problematic
because the amount over/under-spent could be redistributed to further extend its usefulness.
Though this imbalanced expenditure indicates the existence of under-spending members, the Team’s work
will also account for over-spending members.
## Leap in! - Budget Utilisation
Scope:
1. Set up a Relational Database Service (RDS) on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
within Jupyter Notebook.
2. Query the Company’s cloud-based dataset.
3. Adopt the Agile Framework to explore the dataset.
4. Apply Clustering to isolate the several factors that cause the Company’s
members to over/under-spend.
5. Apply Association Mining to ascertain the general profile of an
over/under-spending member.
6. Apply predictive mining to early predict user likely under-spending
7. Generate a well-structured and informative data visualization dashboard.
