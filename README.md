As part of its operations, the Company collects data from its members relevant to the use of their NDIS
budgets. The average NDIS beneficiary receives $52,000 in support per annum, but the Company observes
that its members only spend 68% of this amount on average each year. The reasons could range from a
lack of available services in remote areas to a lack of satisfaction with available services. This is problematic
because the amount over/under-spent could be redistributed to further extend its usefulness.
Though this imbalanced expenditure indicates the existence of under-spending members, the Teamâ€™s work
will also account for over-spending members.
